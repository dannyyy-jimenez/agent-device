# BrowserStack

Use BrowserStack App Automate for hosted Android and iOS WebDriver sessions.

## Credentials and connection

Set BrowserStack credentials in a non-interactive environment:

```bash
export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=...
export BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=...
```

Connect with the platform, exact device and OS version, and app to test:

```bash
agent-device connect browserstack \
  --platform android \
  --device "Google Pixel 8" \
  --provider-os-version 14.0 \
  --provider-app bs://app-id
```

`--provider-app` accepts a BrowserStack app reference such as `bs://...`, an HTTP(S) app URL, or an existing local app path. BrowserStack uploads a local path when it creates the hosted session.

During `connect`, agent-device verifies the BrowserStack credentials and the exact device/OS pair. It checks a `bs://` reference against recent uploads and confirms that a local artifact exists before saving its absolute path. A public URL stays configured and BrowserStack validates it when the session starts. `open` still needs the app's installed package or bundle identifier, not its upload name.

Optional labels:

```bash
--provider-project agent-device
--provider-build "$GITHUB_RUN_ID"
--provider-session-name "$GITHUB_JOB"
```

Optional device features:

```bash
--provider-device-orientation portrait   # or landscape        (alias --device-orientation)
--provider-geo-location US                                   # (alias --geo-location)
--provider-timezone New_York                                 # (alias --timezone)
--provider-language Fr                                       # (alias --language)
--provider-locale Fr                                         # (alias --locale)
--provider-network-profile 4g-lte-advanced-good              # (alias --network-profile)
--provider-custom-network 1000                               # (alias --custom-network)
--provider-no-resign-app                                     # iOS only
```

Optional local tunnel, for reaching a host an IP allowlist would otherwise reject:

```bash
--provider-local
--provider-local-identifier my-tunnel
```

BrowserStack receives these values in `bstack:options` when it creates the hosted session.

- The orientation applies when the session starts. An activity without a fixed orientation, such as a Chrome Custom Tab hosting OAuth, can still open in landscape. Run `agent-device orientation portrait` after launching it when needed.
- `--provider-network-profile` and `--provider-custom-network` are mutually exclusive.
- `--provider-no-resign-app` applies to iOS only. BrowserStack re-signs uploaded iOS apps with its provisioning profile, which strips entitlements; opt out when testing entitlement-dependent features such as push notifications.
- `--provider-local` needs a [BrowserStackLocal](https://www.browserstack.com/docs/app-automate/app-percy/set-up-testing/local-testing) daemon already running. `--provider-local-identifier` must match the daemon's `--local-identifier`, and is rejected without `--provider-local` — BrowserStack ignores it on a non-local session, so the session would run untunneled with no error.

### Reaching a host that resolves publicly

BrowserStack Local only tunnels hosts it cannot resolve publicly. An API that is allowlisted but has
public DNS still egresses from BrowserStack's network and stays unreachable. Start the daemon with
`--force-local` so every request goes through the tunnel:

```bash
BrowserStackLocal --key "$BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY" \
  --local-identifier my-tunnel --force-local --daemon start
```

This is a property of the daemon, not of the session: BrowserStack rejects session creation when a
`forceLocal` capability is sent, so there is no `--provider-force-local` flag.

## Launch arguments

`--launch-args` is forwarded to the app, so a flow can vary per-launch configuration without
re-leasing a device:

```bash
# iOS — process arguments
agent-device open com.example.app \
  --launch-args "-otaChannel" --launch-args "qa-1234"

# Android — am start extras
agent-device open com.example.app \
  --launch-args "--es" --launch-args "otaChannel" --launch-args "qa-1234" \
  --launch-args "--ez" --launch-args "fresh" --launch-args "true"
```

Launch arguments are read once, when the process starts, so a launch carrying them always restarts
the app first — activating it would foreground the old process and drop them silently. A launch
without arguments still activates as before.

- **iOS** sends them as XCUITest process arguments.
- **Android** takes `am start` extra flags (`--es <key> <value>`, `--ez`, `--ei`, `--esn <key>`, and
  the array forms) and translates them into typed intent extras. The activity comes from
  `--activity` when given, otherwise the current one. An unrecognised flag is rejected rather than
  dropped, because Appium validates an extra's type but not its operands.

## CLI workflow

```bash
export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=...
export BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=...

agent-device connect browserstack \
  --platform android \
  --device "Google Pixel 8" \
  --provider-os-version 14.0 \
  --provider-app bs://app-id \
  --provider-project agent-device \
  --provider-build "$GITHUB_RUN_ID"

agent-device open com.example.app
agent-device snapshot -i
agent-device click 'label="Continue"'
agent-device close
agent-device artifacts --json
agent-device disconnect
```

For MCP-only use, run `connect` in the same effective state directory before starting `agent-device mcp`. MCP exposes `open`, `snapshot`, `click`, `close`, and `artifacts`, but not provider `connect` commands.

## Node.js client

Use direct client configuration when the Node process manages BrowserStack credentials and selectors rather than a saved CLI connection profile:

```ts
import { createAgentDeviceClient } from 'agent-device';

const client = createAgentDeviceClient({
  leaseProvider: 'browserstack',
  platform: 'android',
  device: 'Google Pixel 8',
  providerOsVersion: '14.0',
  providerApp: 'bs://app-id',
  providerProject: 'agent-device',
  providerBuild: process.env.GITHUB_RUN_ID,
});

await client.apps.open({ app: 'com.example.app' });
const snapshot = await client.capture.snapshot({ interactiveOnly: true });
console.log(snapshot.nodes.slice(0, 5));
await client.interactions.click({ selector: 'label="Continue"' });
const closed = await client.sessions.close();
const providerSessionId = closed.provider?.providerSessionId;

if (providerSessionId) {
  const artifacts = await client.sessions.artifacts({
    provider: 'browserstack',
    providerSessionId,
  });
  console.log(artifacts.cloudArtifacts);
}
```

## Artifacts and troubleshooting

After `close`, BrowserStack can return session video, Appium logs, device logs, dashboard URLs, and public URLs. Run `agent-device artifacts --json`, or look up a previous session explicitly:

```bash
agent-device artifacts <webdriver-session-id> --provider browserstack --json
```

BrowserStack errors distinguish rejected credentials, an unavailable device/OS pair, a missing `bs://` upload, and a missing local artifact. If artifact lookup is pending immediately after `close`, retry it. BrowserStack may still be finalizing video and log URLs.

On hosted WebDriver sessions, `fill` checks that the field received focus before it sends keys. If it cannot confirm focus, it fails without typing. Use `snapshot -i` to confirm the target. If the driver cannot expose focus at all, use `press <target>` followed by `type <text>`. That sends text without confirming the destination.
